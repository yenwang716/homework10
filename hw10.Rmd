## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
acc %>% filter(HOUR <=24) %>% group_by(HOUR) %>% tally()
```{r}
acc %>% group_by(DAY_WEEK) %>% tally()
acc %>% ggplot(aes(x = DAY_WEEK)) + geom_bar()
acc.hour = acc %>% filter(HOUR <= 24) %>% group_by(HOUR) %>% tally()
acc %>% filter(HOUR <= 24) %>% group_by(HOUR) %>% ggplot(aes(x = HOUR)) + geom_bar()
table(acc$DRUNK_DR)

```
